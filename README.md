Lexica is a robust virtual dialogue system framework that is adaptable to different conversational platform such as facebook messenger, telegram, website chat...etc. By default, most of the codebase works with Amazon web service out of the box. It can be extended easily to work with other cloud solution provider. I will also continue add more module to support Google Cloud and Azure.
