## Introduction

Lexica is a robust **virtual dialogue system framework** that can adapt to different conversational platform such as facebook messenger, telegram, website chat...etc. By default, most of the codebase works with **Amazon web service** out of the box. It can be extended easily to work with other cloud solution provider. I will also continue add more module to support Google Cloud and Azure.
